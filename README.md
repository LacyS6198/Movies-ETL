# Overview
The purpose of Module 8 was to learn ETL functions (extract, transform, load). The module lessons covered how to extract data from both CSV and JSON format. After the data was extracted, it was read and analyzed to understand what transformations were required. Once the data was understood, the data was transformed. It was transformed in multiple ways including:

- filling blank data
- removing NULLS
- changing field formatting
- merging dataframes

Once all data transformtaion was complete, the data was then loaded to tables in PostgreSQL.
